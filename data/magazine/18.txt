Stanley Cup 15 preview – Western|09.04.2009|sollu|<img class="magazine" align="left" width="125 px" alt="picture" title="Stanley Cup 15 preview – Western" src="http://stanleycup.crash.sk/img/western.png">|Following Eastern Conference preview, let’s have a closer look to the more successful conference – the Western. St.Louis Blues regained the Stanley Cup title back to the West last season increasing the number of Western titles to 9 and number of Western winners to 4 (following Anaheim, Colorado and Vancouver). <br />  <br /> <b>Northwest division</b> <br /> Edmonton and Vancouver changed managers since last season, Minnesota changed manager during last season and 11 times division winner Colorado sold its squad what dramatically changes situation in the Northwest. Wild, Oilers and Canucks are considered as top 3 teams in the division, all of them able to reach division title, all of them willing to show their strength in first (full) season of their managers in the tournament. Most successful team of the tournament’s history Colorado Avalanche is not expected to reach anything more than just some lucky goals and will fall to the bottom of the division, behind last season surprising division winner Calgary Flames. <br />  <br /> Expected standings: <br /> 1. Edmonton <br /> 2. Minnesota <br /> 3. Vancouver <br /> 4. Calgary <br /> 5. Colorado <br />  <br />  <br /> <b>Central division</b> <br /> It took 14 seasons till Central division team reached Stanley Cup finals… Defending Stanley Cup champions St.Louis Blues were the best or second best in the division in last 5 seasons, if the Blues want to defend the Cup successfully, winning their own division is almost must. Blues will be again challenged mainly by Chicago Blackhawks, but both Detroit and Columbus have potential to change boringly stable top of the Central division. Both Red Wings as well as Blue Jackets already proved that they are able to win some big games. Nashville remained at the bottom of the division for too long, team has some potential to surprise division rivals. More than anywhere else, Central will be affected by which manager will care about the tournament less. <br />  <br /> Expected standings: <br /> 1. St.Louis <br /> 2. Detroit <br /> 3. Chicago <br /> 4. Nashville <br /> 5. Columbus <br />  <br />  <br /> <b>Pacific division</b> <br /> Pacific will meet Central in upcoming regular season what promises a lot of equal matches what will definitely shuffle the cards in both divisions. Four fairly equal teams in the Pacific may be looking for division title this time, only one of them - San Jose Sharks already knows how it feels. But Dallas was very close to the division title last season, loosing the race by worse score only. Los Angeles Kings surprised last season qualifying to the playoffs after long 9 seasons and Kings almost outperformed division rival Dallas in Conference quarter finals. On the other hand Phoenix ended last season without playoffs after 3 1st round appearances in row. The only team in the Pacific which is hardly expected to perform something special is Anaheim. <br />  <br /> Expected standings: <br /> 1. Dallas <br /> 2. San Jose <br /> 3. Phoenix <br /> 4. Los Angeles <br /> 5. Anaheim <br />  <br />  <br /> <b>Conference standings:</b> <br /> 1. St.Louis <br /> 2. Edmonton <br /> 3. Dallas <br /> 4. Detroit <br /> 5. Minnesota <br /> 6. San Jose <br /> 7. Chicago <br /> 8. Vancouver <br /> 9. Phoenix <br /> 10. Los Angeles <br /> 11. Calgary <br /> 12. Nashville <br /> 13. Anaheim <br /> 14. Colorado <br /> 15.
