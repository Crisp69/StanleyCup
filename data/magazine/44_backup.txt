PLAYOFF TIME!|25.02.2010|petrik||13 rounds of the regular season separated the teams into two groups: the succesful ones are preparing for hard playoffs battles that starts this weekend, the less succesfull ones can use the extra free time and try to prepare themselves better for next season. <br /> Playoffs are usualy the most exciting part of the season, so lets take a look at the upcoming 1st round matchups. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> <b>EASTERN CONFERENCE</b> <br />  <br /> <b>1st FLORIDA PANTHERS vs. 8th MONTREAL CANDIENS</b> <br /> Panthers begin their quest for defending the title against the only eastern conference canadian team that makes it into the PO - Montreal Canadiens. Habs certainly have nothing to loose in this matchup, so they should at least try to make it as difficult as possible for hot favourites Panthers <br /> <i>odds: 80-20</i> <br />  <br /> <b>2nd BOSTON BRUINS vs. 7th PHILADELPHIA FLYERS</b> <br /> Flyaers managed to defend the playoff spot at the end of regular season and they are not without chance in the 1st round too. Bruins singlehandedly won northeast division, but underestimating Flyers could be fatal, as this dog still has some teeth left for a deathly bite. <br /> <i>odds: 55-45</i> <br />  <br /> <b>3rd NEW YORK RANGERS vs. 6th WASHINGTON CAPITALS</b> <br /> The two teams haven´t met in the playoffs since the very first Stanley Cup season. Caps have a little advantage over their oponent in net and at the end it could easily be all that matters. <br /> <i>odds: 45-55</i> <br />  <br /> <b>4th TAMPA BAY LIGHTNING vs. 5th ATLANTA THRASHERS</b> <br /> the battle of southest division rivals promises an interesting hockey. Thrashers are more experienced, but young Bolts have much better special teams so far this season. So the clear favourite of the two is hard to find as both teams should have a solid chance of making it to the 2nd round. <br /> <i>odds: 45-55</i> <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> <b>WESTERN CONFERENCE <br />  <br /> 1st COLUMBUS BLUE JACKETS vs. 8th CALGARY FLAMES</b> <br /> Who said that claiming the top seed spot in the conference standing is best for the playoffs? Presidents trophy winners Blue Jackets could soon learn that every rule has an exception of some kind, as they have to battle the pre-season favourite Calgary Flames in the 1st round of the playoffs. Will the Flames manage to ressurect their so far dissapointing season? This is their last chance if they want to. <br /> <i>odds: 55-45</i> <br />  <br /> <b>2nd DALLAS STARS vs. 7th ST.LOUIS BLUES</b> <br /> Stars dominated the league since the very beggining and even if they lost Presidents trophy to Columbus at the end of regular season, they are still a team to count on. Blues own a 3-0 overal record in playoffs matchups against Dallas, but revenge is a dish best served cold and Stars look pretty hungry... <br /> <i>odds: 65-35</i> <br />  <br />  <br /> <b>3rd VANCOUVER CANUCKS vs. 6th ANAHEIM DUCKS</b> <br /> The great rivalry of old may get some rejuvenation soon. Nucks and Ducks faced each other 7 times in 8 years in seasons 03-10 in the playoffs (and most of their meetings were ones to remeber!), but rivalry faded a bit since then as they met just twice in the regular season since season 11. Canucks will rely on one of the best special teams in the league, while Ducks will hope their star players Simontaival and Tynjälä will manage to steal the show for them. <br /> <i>odds: 60-40</i> <br />  <br /> <b>4th NASHVILLE PREDATORS vs. 5th COLORADO AVALANCHE</b> <br /> Best PP in the tournament vs. 2nd best goalie. But veteran Zbysek Smid would have to do miracles if young Avs want to be any challenge for the much more experienced Predators team. This could be a rough wake up call for the Avs, from the sweet dreams they were living in whole season as they are probably not yet ready to make any bigger noise in the playoffs.  <br /> <i>odds: 60-40</i> |80.250.252.38
