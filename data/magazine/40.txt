ROUNDS 1-3 REVIEW|18.01.2010|petrik|<img class="magazine" align="left" width="100 px" alt="picture" title="ROUNDS 1-3 REVIEW" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ZYWpQdIOQKxfZM%3Ahttp://www.insidesocal.com/tomhoffarth/thumbs_up_down.jpg">|<b><u>THUMS UP – EASTERN CONFERENCE</u> <br />  <br />BOSTON BRUINS</b> – wins over the Leafs and Sabres were more or less expected, but defeating Flyers – who played in full strenght – by three goals 5-2 is especialy praiseworthy. <br />  <br /> <b>NEW JERSEY DEVILS</b> – underdog of this season pleasently suprised their fans in the first round, defeating the rival Rangers 5-1. even if the young Devils loose the next two games, 2 points are more than many had hoped for. <br />  <br /> <b><u>THUMBS DOWN – EASTERN CONFERENCE</u> <br />  <br /> PHILADELPHIA FLYERS</b> – loss to the Ducks in a day when they couldn´t use their best players because of national team duties is at least understandable, but loosing also to Bruins the next day was pure shock for their fans. Flyers could and should have done better than 2 points out of 3 games. <br />  <br /> <b><u>THUMBS UP – WESTERN CONFERENCE</u> <br />  <br /> DALLAS STARS</b> – Stars are suprising leader and the only team with full 6 points in tight packed western conference. Especialy the win over Ducks in opening night was kind of suprising. Excellent start of the season. <br />  <br /> <b>COLORADO AVALANCHE</b> – If MVP of the first weekend shoud be chosen, my vote would go to the Zbysek Smid. Avs veteran goalie stole 4 points for his team with two shutouts against Oilers and Red Wings. 12 goals scored in 3 games are also pretty good for the young Avalanche team. <br />  <br /> <b>CHICAGO BLACKHAWKS</b> – hawks fans have to be satisfied with their new manager – two wins and one close loss, with entertaining high-energy offensive style of play is maybe even more than they hoped for. <br />  <br /> <b><u>THUMBS DOWN – WESTERN CONFERENCE</u> <br />  <br /> ST.LOUIS BLUES</b> – despite playing against the better teams of the tournament, just 1 point out of 3 games is not a result that defending Presidents Trophy champion can be satisfied with. <br />  <br /> <b>EDMONTON OILERS</b> – Oilers loses to Colorado and Minnesota were one of the biggest suprises of the first rounds. 13 goals against in 3 games show with no doubts where improvements have to be made if Oilers want to contend for the playoffs in the west. <br />  <br /> <b>DETROIT RED WINGS</b> – Detroit started the season slow – just 2 goals scored in 3 games (worst in the tournament along with Senators) are very poor result for such experienced team. It was enough for at least 1 win tough, thanks to the solid defense, but fans in Motortown can hardly be satisfied. |80.250.252.38
