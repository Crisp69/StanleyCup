Other than that, he put home players into misery, making several unbelievable saves. <br />  <br /> On the other hands, home fans could hardly be satisfied with the performance of their pair of goalies. Veteran Heiner Schukart start the game in net, but was replaced early in the second period after allowing third goal in just 10 shots. but Edwin Sjoholm who took his place didn´t do much better, allowing another 3 goals in remaining 38 minutes and finishing the game with 14 saves and 82.4 svs%. <br />  <br /> 5 players shared 6 blackhawks goals with young latvian rising star Kaspars Lejins tallying twice in the PP. Hawks capitalized on 4 out of 11 PP oportunities and killed 2 of 3 own penalties. <br />  <br /> GM petrik couldn´t hide a satisfied smile after the game, but refused any comments until after the second and final game of the series tonight in Chicago. |87.244.196.218
