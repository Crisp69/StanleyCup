Pittsburgh signed Radek Dvorak|13.01.2010|tomson|<img class="magazine" align="left" width="300 px" alt="picture" title="Pittsburgh signed Radek Dvorak" src="http://downloads.panthers.nhl.com/other/Wallpaper/200910_RadekDvorak_1024.jpg">|The Pittsburgh Penguins continued to get a makeover and signed winger Radek Dvorak.  <br />  <br /> The club announced the deal on Wednesday, but no details were released. According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the deal is for one-season and is worth $7.5 million. <br />  <br /> 'Dvorak is a highly-skilled player with good offensive instincts and the ability to play on the wing or at the centre position,' said Pens president and general manager in a statement on Wednesday.  <br />  <br /> 'We think he will give us added flexibility and brings a veteran presence to our lineup.' <br />  <br /> The 28-year old Czech Republic native became a Penguin just before the start of the new season. He will fit in the Pens fourth line. 'Radek will be a great asset to our penalty kill,' head coach added. <br />  <br /> The addition of Dvorak is among several changes the Pens have made in an effort to bring the cup to the Steel City. <br />  <br /> As part of the rebuilding process for a team that made it to the play-offs just twice, the Pens signed top prospect Joe Sakic in October, blueliner Sergey Gonchar in November and winger Mikael Samuelsson in December. |85.216.151.120
