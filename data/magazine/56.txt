Gordie Howe returns to his old city|15.10.2011|tomson|<img  class="magazine" align="left" width="300 px" alt="picture" title="Gordie Howe returns to his old city" src="http://www.hockeyforum.com/photopost/data/2/GORDIE_HOWE_DETROIT_PHOTO_1000.bmp">|Howe is back in Detroit tonight. An all-time hockey legend is visiting the city he put on the map. The question hovering over the Mr. Hockey's return was not whether his new team, the Pittsburgh Penguins, would beat his old one. <br />  <br /> No, the reason all of hockeydom is riveted to this clash is to see whether Howe would be booed or cheered by the people of Detroit. And how long would the booing or cheering last? <br />  <br /> Howe looked forward to Saturday night's game in Detroit with something less than relish. It was not the pressure or scrutiny that had him spooked - he described the matchup as "just another one of those 'everybody's-watching' games"- but rather the idea of playing against his best friends. <br />  <br /> "I'd really rather not have to go in there," said Howe, with a sigh. "We were the closest team, I think, that's ever been assembled in pro sports. It's going to be extremely tough." <br />  <br /> Pens signed Howe just couple of hours prior to the game. PittsburghÂ´s GM announced shortly afterward that he will take part in the club's morning skate. <br />  <br /> Howe said he was ready to jump back over the boards. It only gives the game an added interest that No. 9 will make his season debut against the team he is and will be so deeply attached to. |89.173.80.100
