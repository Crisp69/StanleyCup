One of the main reasons was that Chicago manager petrik dared to give the majority of his veterans a day off after the safe 5 goal victory. just few more minutes of play and he could have bitterly regret it. <br />  <br /> Flames dominated from the first draw and took the 1-0 lead after opening period with Michael Moser scoring the 1st goal in 18th minute. <br /> this time it was Chicago´s turn to change their goalies early in the second period. Stipo Pulja left his place in net to veteran and fan favourite Alfred Cvirik after Flames scored their second goal. Pulja recorded 12 saves and 85,7 svs% in 25 finutes of play. <br />  <br /> but Cvirik also wasn´t able to stop surging Flames - Andis Plikškis made it 3-0 before the half of the game and home fans suddenly began to worry about reaching the conf. semifinals which they took for granted before the game. even more after Maté Franz made it 4-0 just 12 seconds into the 3rd period and Hawks were suddenly 1 goal from elimination. but Blackhawks led by outstanding Cvirik managed to keep desperate Flames from scoring the last needed goal and welcomed the final whistle with great relief and joy.  <br />  <br /> Blackhawks will play another rare oponent in the western conf. semifinals - Dallas Stars. Hawks won the only one meeting of these two teams prior to upcoming playoff series, but that was 10 seasons ago.  <br /> Stars advance to the semifinals through LA Kings after two extremely equal and defensive minded games, which both ended with 1-1 tie. <br />  <br /> 1st game of the semifinal series will be played on Saturday 21st March in Dallas, second and final game of the series the next day in Chicago. |87.244.196.218
