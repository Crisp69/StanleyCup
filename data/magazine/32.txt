Pens win pre-season opener|05.01.2010|tomson|<img class="magazine" align="left" width="300 px" alt="picture" title="Pens win pre-season opener" src="http://cdn2.sbnation.com/entry_photo_images/32510/47038_penguins_hurricanes_hockey.jpg">|The Pens took down the first game of the pre-season with a 2-1 win over the Carolina Hurricanes. Kovalchuk and Salo had both a goal while highly touted prospect Ray Bourque picked up a helper.  <br />  <br /> Kovalchuk dinged one off the post in the first. No worries. The posts are slimmer in Carolina.  <br />  <br /> Led by the Lemieux Line, the out-shot Penguins have put out an outstanding performance. Kovalchuk looked like he was still in a season mode as he embarrassed the Canes with his incredible stick handling scoring a spectacular goal.  <br />  <br /> As for Super Mario, well as always, Lemieux wasn’t so super for the PRESEASON game. He didn’t appear on the scoreboard and played only two periods. 'There are some individual players that have not quite played to their potential, but Mario will be back in shape just in time for league opener,' Pens head coach said. <br />  <br /> In goal, the young Dominik Hasek stood for the entire game. Hasek played a solid game, but isn’t still worthy to unseat No. 1 netminder Ilya Bryzgalov. |85.248.69.108
