Satan comes to Pittsburgh|18.01.2010|tomson|<img class="magazine" align="left" width="300 px" alt="picture" title="Satan comes to Pittsburgh" src="http://ms.hokej.sk/obrazky/41/41209.jpg">|The Pittsburgh Penguins have been looking for a long-term solution to plant on Sidney Crosby's left or right side. They had hoped to have found the answer last season when they acquired sniper Marcus Naslund.  <br />  <br /> But Naslund, Crosby's only superstar winger, did not performed as expected alongside Sid. <br />  <br /> This team needed that elite winger playing with Crosby to regain near-championship status. <br />  <br /> It was nice to see all the fans with Bure, Straka and Hasek jerseys simply pumped and excited to see their team battle it out in play-offs. But that was 13 seasons ago. Those times are gone for good. For the Penguins to return to that form, GM almost certainly had to get his hands on another top forwards. <br />  <br /> Looking at Pittsburgh's roster, there weren't many tradable assets. General manager wasn't about to trade away guys like Mark Messier or Patrik Elias to free up enough space to add a top six winger. <br />  <br /> Considering the options that were available, the Penguins were relatively limited in who they can try to acquire. <br />  <br /> As it stood, the logical choice was to go for a talented top prospect Miroslav Satan.  <br />  <br /> The 19-year-old Slovak phenom penned his first contract, an eight-year entry-level pact that was announced on Saturday. The deal knocked down the final hurdle toward seeing Satan in a Penguin sweater on Saturday night in game against San Jose Sharks. <br />  <br /> The Penguins, who finished without a point last season, are leaning on a young core of players including Satan, Michal Pivonka and Joe Sakic to turn around a club that scored just 1 goal last season. <br />  <br /> 'It's an exciting time for the Penguins organization as we develop our young talent into a contender,' Pens GM said. 'Miroslav provides another important piece to help us achieve our ultimate goal of winning a Stanley Cup.' <br />  <br /> Satan will be under the spotlight from the start among the young Penguins. Satan and the Pens believe their rookie will be uniquely equipped to handle the spotlight, given his star status throughout Slovakia since he was 16 years old. <br />  <br /> 'I'm excited to officially become a part of the Pittsburgh Penguins organization and begin my professional career this upcoming season,' Satan said Sunday. 'I look forward to joining the Penguins and be part of a team that's ultimate goal is to bring the first cup to the Steel City,' he added. <br />  <br /> It is a guarantee that he'd play alongside Crosby. With his speed, toughness and hands, Satan can plant himself in the opposition's crease, dig the puck out of the corners and easily pot in a nifty pass from Sid to give the Penguins a win. |85.216.151.120
