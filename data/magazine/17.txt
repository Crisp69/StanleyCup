Eastern Conference was always considered as more equal than Western, but teams from East have limited success in winning the Stanley Cup, winning only one title in last 5 seasons and only 5 titles in 14 season Stanley Cup history. <br />  <br /> <b>Northeast division</b> <br /> Last season surprising Presidentsâ€™ Trophy winner Toronto changed manager, Ottawa Senators which won the division title in previous 2 seasons changed manager last season, last season weakest team in the division Boston Bruins changed the manager this season. With all this changes, Montreal Canadiens seem to be a sticking out of this poll and might be considered as hottest favourite for the division throne. Tough and even battles among Boston, Ottawa and Toronto will decide who will and who will not make the playoffs from Northeast, while Buffalo will most probably regain the n 5 position in the division. <br />  <br /> Expected standings: <br /> 1. Montreal <br /> 2. Ottawa <br /> 3. Toronto <br /> 4. Boston <br /> 5. Buffalo <br />  <br />  <br /> <b>Atlantic division</b> <br /> New Jersey Devils reached the Stanley Cup finals 3 times in last 5 seasons but never succeded in the last series of the season. New York Rangers are always considered as one of top favourites of the tournament but with no success in the playoff run. As always, it is expected that this might be the season for Rangers to fight for Conference title at least. Devils and Rangers will probably fight for the division throne in the Atlantic, while unpredictable Philadeplhia Flyers and underrated New York Islanders will share n 3 and 4 in the division, depending on how many surprising wins Flyers can manage this time. Pengiuns are again conviceted to the bottom of the division standings <br />  <br /> Expected standings: <br /> 1. Rangers <br /> 2. Devils <br /> 3. Flyers <br /> 4. Islanders <br /> 5. Pittsburg <br />  <br />  <br /> <b>Southeast division</b> <br /> Florida Panthers is the only team from Eastern which won the Stanley Cup in last 5 seasons, winning also the division title in last season. Panthers are being challenged by ambitious Atlanta Thrashers in the battle for division throne. Equal trio of Carolina, Tampa Bay and Washington will share remaining positions in the division. Carolina changed manager this season and is looking to prove their spot in the tournament, Capitals showed less than average performance last season and should improve a lot to manage to the playoffs and Tampa Bay is looking to repeat their last season performance but improve their playoff record being not able to pass Conference quarterfinals in last 8 seasons. <br />  <br /> Expected standings: <br /> 1. Atlanta <br /> 2. Florida <br /> 3. Carolina <br /> 4. Tampa Bay <br /> 5. Washington <br />  <br />  <br /> <b>Conference Standings:</b> <br /> 1. Rangers <br /> 2. Montreal <br /> 3. Atlanta <br /> 4. Devils <br /> 5. Florida <br /> 6. Ottawa <br /> 7. Flyers <br /> 8. Toronto <br /> 9. Carolina <br /> 10. Tampa Bay <br /> 11. Boston <br /> 12. Buffalo <br /> 13. Washington <br /> 14. Islanders <br /> 15. Pittsburg |212.5.222.203
