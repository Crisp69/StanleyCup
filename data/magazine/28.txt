Proud witness of this event is Atlanta Thrashers goalie Juraj Banka, he said, it was his night to remember. And he will remember it well :) <br />  <br /> Haluška started his concert in the middle of first period, as his goal gave the AVS the lead 2:1, than he scored 3 more goals in 13 minutes. He added his goal number 5 in the third period and he closed the score of the game with a shorthanded tally 5 minutes to go. He scored 4 goals on passes from his linemate Richard Groves... |85.216.253.148
