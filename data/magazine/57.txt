Canucks up for grabs!|30.11.2011|petrik 2.0||Hello Stanley cup managers! <br />  <br /> those of you with long enough history in this tournament and good memory will maybe remember me - some time ago, I spent couple of seasons here as a manager of St.Louis Blues and later Chicago Blackhawks during my first stint on HA. for those of you who don´t remember these golden ages let me introduce myself - my HA nick is petrik (now after my return from 2 yrs long HA holidays - petrik 2.0), and I was honored by sollu by allowing me back to this great tournament as a manager of the last free team for season 29 - Vancouver Canucks (despite the fact that my very new team is far from being competitive against such strong teams as yours are). <br /> but my favourite NHL team is Colorado, so you might guess that I do not feel any special sympathy to my new Stanley Cup team - Vancouver Canucks. so if any of you think that a change of scenery would do your team some good (a bit weaker opponents maybe, or more favourite opponents to play against or higher income - whatever), or you are bored by playing too long for the same team or if any of you for whatever reasons would be willing to switch your current Stanley Cup team for Vancouver Canucks, this is your chance - just let me know via HA mail. <br /> thanks for reading, it´s good to be back |80.250.252.38
