Conference semifinals preview|21.03.2009|sollu|<img class="magazine" align="left" width="250 px" alt="picture" title="Conference semifinals preview" src="http://www2.pictures.gi.zimbio.com/Philadelphia+Flyers+v+New+Jersey+Devils+-mL5NIaYfB4l.jpg">|3 Atlantic teams in round two, no appearence from Northwest and for sure a brand new Stanley Cup finals representant from the West. These are main points for Stanley Cup Conference semifinals weekend, lets have a closer look to whats going to happen... <br />  <br /> <b>Devils vs. Flyers</b> <br /> Atlantic division rivals Philly and Devils are meeting in the playoffs for the first time. In regular season, Philly won 8 out of 13 games, including this season tight matchup (3:2). Devils won the division this season, 5 points ahead of Flyers.  <br /> New Jersey are considered as stable playoff team, they played playoffs in last 6 seasons including 2 Stanley Cup finals apperances against Colorado. On the other hand, Trsto is known for forgetting to set up substitutes for NT players on Saturdays too often, what ended teams playoff run last season and also started this season in heavy loss 0:12 to NYR.  <br /> Philly is taking part in Conference semifinals series for the second time in teams history, previous Conf semifinals apperance is 6 seasons old.  <br /> Both teams are looking forward to this tough rivality series but Devils seem to be a little bigger favorite this time... <br />  <br /> <b>Florida - Rangers</b> <br /> Panthers lost last 2 meetings to Rangers, NY squad swept Florida this season 8:2, but Panthers were still able to win Southeast division.  <br /> Defending Stanley Cup champion is being challenged by an ambitious team, which is always considered as a favorite for the title but never shown much success in the playoffs run.  <br /> Best Rangers playoffs performance is Prince of Wales Trophy in season 7, since then they never went through 2nd round of playoffs.  <br /> Very tight matchup might be decided by little things, like will Panthers give a chance to their young goalie Strandberg and how many NT players will miss each team tonight. Overall, Rangers have a little bigger chance to win this series... <br />  <br /> <b>Blues - Wild</b> <br /> First ever playoff matchup between Wild and Blues after only 1 regular season meeting between these team ever from season 3. <br /> Central division winner has been a stable regular season team in last seasons but has never made any success in the playoffs. Best St.Louis playoff run was in season 11 loosing to Colorado in Conference finals. <br /> Wild has changed manager during this season and seem to be resurrected. Wild swept Pacific division winner in round 1 and lost only twice in last 11 games becoming one of Conference favorites. They didnt participate in playoffs for last 3 season and never went through round 1. <br /> According to the poll, this will be the toughest series in Conference semifinals weekend, hard to predict, the luckiest wins. <br />  <br /> <b>Stars - Blackhawks</b> <br /> Another extremly rare matchup in this playoff round, only meeting between Chicago and Dallas was 9 season ago.  <br /> Dallas has never had any success in the playoffs, always being stopped in the first round - 3 times by Colorado and once by Anaheim. <br /> Chicago stills remembers last two seasons dissapointment losses to Colorado in Conference finals, this team didnt miss playoff ever (except from season 11, when Chicago didnt play in the tournament). <br /> Both teams have potential for Conference Finals, maybe Stars will be too high this time for Hawks... |89.173.61.110
