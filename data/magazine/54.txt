SC 28 PREVIEW - EASTERN CONFERENCE|02.10.2011|tomson||Yet another season begins in few days and there are again more questions than answers. Will Hurricanes defend their first ever Stanley Cup title? Can Ottawa win at least one game in regular season? And who will be once again knocked-out in the first play-off round? It´s that time of year again – pre-season prediction time.  <br />  <br /> Let´s have a look on the order of team finishes, in both conferences, for the upcoming regular season. The decisions were based on last season rankings, progress made since then and off-season changes in teams. But as it goes in sports, all might look completely different in three months time from now.  <br />  <br /> 1.) <b>Toronto Maple Leafs</b> (1st, Notheast Division) <br /> The Toronto Maple Leafs had one of the smoothest regular seasons in the NHL, coasting into the playoffs without a shadow of a doubt. When they reached the post-season, the failure to acquire a proven scorer took its toll on the team, and the Leafs were again bounced in the second round to a much more physical and intimidating club. Seems like this season can be a tipping-point for acapone.  <br />  <br /> 2.) <b>Florida Panthers</b> (1st, Southeast Division) <br /> -Florida finally exercised its most recent playoff demons and did so against the mighty Maple Leafs in route to an Eestern Conference Finals appearance. How the Panthers transition into a perennial power in the playoffs and not just the regular season will be this season’s true test. <br />  <br /> 3.) <b>Pittsburgh Penguins</b> (1st, Atlantic Division) <br /> -The Penguins did what they had to do in the off-season by signing probably their best player, fan favorite, and team leader Radek Dvorak. A demanding fan base that hadn’t seen much success finally got their first play-off series after more than 20 seasons. This could be the one Pittsburgh takes over the top spot in the Atlantic division from Philadelphia. <br />  <br /> 4.) <b>Winnipeg Jets</b>  <br /> -Have to give the defending Presidents´ Trophy Champion the benefit of the doubt but as always, they will only go as far as Michel Meili takes them. It will be interesting to see how they respond to the obvious ageing of the team. Acquisition of some decent forwards should help. <br />  <br /> 5.) <b>Carolina Hurricanes</b>  <br /> - Thanks to a roster that sports two of the game's top stars (Art Ross Trophy winner Hilary Kupczyk being one of them) , the Hurricanes once again will be excellent, but the wear-and-tear of a Stanley Cup run likely will preclude them from winning an Eastern Conference regular-season title. If Canes will be able to keep the winning squad together, the season may end up by reaching the finals once again. <br />  <br /> 6.) <b>Montreal Canadiens</b>  <br /> - Any hockey purest recognizes that the Canadiens are one of the most storied franchises in the Stanley Cup tournament. And they’d be lying if they told you that they didn’t want to see them in the playoffs perennially. But it´s been long 19 season since Montreal lift the Cup and the play-off curse of the first round still persists. This is a franchise that has had more questions than answers in recent history and this season will be no different.  <br />  <br /> 7.) <b>Buffalo Sabres</b> <br /> -The great thing about the Buffalo Sabres is their lineup rarely changes, so success comes down to execution. On the strength of Franco Vernetti up front and former Vezina Trophy winner Michal Fejes in net, Buffalo has two game-breakers. The defense got tougher thanks to the addition of Jaroslaw Osada, so look for the Sabres to be another tough out in the playoffs. <br />  <br /> 8.) <b>New York Rangers</b> <br /> -The Rangers were one of the youngest teams in the league last season and played like it for much of the campaign before a late season charge saw them just two points outside of a playoff spot. The recent additions of Christian Kretschmer and Bazil Emovic might earn the Blueshirts their first playoff birth since season 19. <br />  <br /> 9.) <b>New York Islanders</b>  <br /> -Stipey is back for his third season with the team he had since managed to break its way into the play-offs. With Elemir Lohyna in goal and an underrated — if unspectacular — blueline, the Isles are poised to be competitive again in the East this season. But the cut-to-the minimum offense will likely suffer during longer injuries, meaning Islanders will fall some. <br />  <br /> 10.) <b>Washington Capitals</b> <br /> Like every Washington team of recent memory, this season’s lineup is full of youth and promise…but it’s also full of too many “ifs” – if the youngsters produce, if the defense is good enough to hold off the snipers from Southeast superpowers, etc. Until speedysportwhiz dedicates itself to winning, Caps will continue to flounder in the wrong half of the standings. <br />  <br /> 11.) <b>Boston Bruins</b>  <br /> - Boston finished 12th last season and just that much points outside of a playoff spot as it earned in a whole season. Bruins will likely challenge for a low-seed playoff spot, but unless new additions Jure Podgorsek and Viesturs Elleris step up in a huge way, we see them on the outside of the post-season picture for the eighth straight campaign.  <br />  <br /> 12.) <b>Philadelphia Flyers</b>  <br /> - After four-straight post-season appearances from season 24, the Flyers are finding out that wise coaching and a keep ´em all roster budget no longer cut it in the unpredictable East. Philadelphia has an all-star caliber goalie in Josef Spacil and a young, skilled, bruising D-corps. But with no scoring stars up front, the Flyers are destined to fall short of the playoffs. <br />  <br /> 13.) <b>New Jersey Devils</b> <br /> - The Devils are not afraid to admit they’re rebuilding. The problem is Trsto´s team doesn’t have the horses to run and gun. A healthy Marek Majik will help, but a big season from a number of kids is needed for New Jersey to have any chance of success. <br />  <br /> 14.) <b>Ottawa Senators</b>  <br /> The Senators are one of the youngest teams in the NHL and had a miserable season last year and continue the rebuilding process. On the bright side, they have nowhere to go but up. The signing of promising prospects Zianon Kaviarnia and Jakub Stepan may be the answer to question what were the Sens waiting for so long. <br />  <br /> 15.) <b>Tampa Bay Lightning</b>  <br /> - The Bystrik Bacinsky Era might begin this season in Tampa – but unfortunately for Lightning fans, too much of their lousy past remains. Their too-young-to-perform players at just about every position and their ultra-tough competition in the Southeast Division, featuring the defending champion Hurricanes, improved Panthers and always tough Jets, predict not much improvement in the points department this season. |89.173.80.100
