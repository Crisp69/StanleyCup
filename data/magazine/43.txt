BLACK AND WHITE|10.02.2010|petrik||this story will be about teams of 2 managers, that are playing in this tournament since the very beginning. but that is the only thing they have common - at least this season. other than that, their stories can hardly be any different. <br />  <br /> <b>PHILADELPHIA FLYERS</b> <br /> Flyers won 4 division titles in the row prior to this season, and there were no signs this year should be any different. but the reality is colder than icy shower for all Flyers fans, as their team managed to win no more than 2 out of 9 games this season and with 6 points currently sits on the edge of elimination from the playoffs at 8th place.  <br /> what went wrong in Philly? <br />  <br /> looking at the players stats, it is clear that problem is not in the goalie. Burkhard Kohler is doing even better than last season (92.1% svs) even if he already faced 60+ more shots than in the same number of games last season. <br />  <br /> so what else is often a deciding factor in hockey games? yup, special teams. but that is also not a problem here, as Flyers PP and PK are both solid, better than league average. <br />  <br /> so the goalie is good, special teams too and yet the team keeps on loosing. the problem has to be with the players performance on even strenght situation. they are just outplayed. struggling to score, soft on defence, outshot on regular basis. Flyers probably underestimated the result of selling couple of experienced veterans, and the younger guys still have a lot to learn. <br /> price for that could possibly be pretty high - Flyers are in real danger of missing the playoffs for the first time in last 7 seasons. <br />  <br />  <br /> <b>COLORADO AVALANCHE</b>  <br /> now if Flyers were a powerhouse of their division the last couple of seasons, Avalanche went through lenghty rebuilding process which resulted in ojnly one short visit to the playoffs in last 5 seasons. and while nobody doubts their anticipation of future success, few believed they would be ready as soon as this season. yet they proved all the prognosis wrong so far and with great performances consistently night after night has earned themself full respect of opponents. <br />  <br /> so what is behind this \"wonder of the west\"? <br /> goalie Zbisek Smid was outstanding last year too, but this season he finaly has adequate help from the defence in front of him too. the result is just 9 goals allowed in 9 games - the second best number in the tournament behind only Columbus (8). <br /> the offence also got themselves going compared to last season - after just 9 games 4 players already have more points than their leading scorer at the end of last season. especialy the pair of Richard Groves and Gabriel Green, who combined for 16 goals and 32 points so far and thanks to their names initials and ability to make Avs fans a \"hockey orgasms\" with stellar on ice performances, earns themselves a nickname \"G-point Duo\" <br />  <br /> Avalanche just began to live in their bright future. |80.250.252.38
