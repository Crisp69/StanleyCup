New Jersey Tribune|06.03.2009|Trsto||Awaiting us the last two rounds! And the question is : <br /> Which team will win President trophy? <br />  <br /> There are only two favorites in our opinion and there are : Toronto and St.Luis. Toronto has a greater chance,cuz Toronto will host the penultimate round of Calgary, while St.Luis welcome Rangers.  <br /> And in the last round, waiting light toronto training unit in battle with the young men in Colorado.This means that they acquire the necessary 4 points and St.Luis struggle Islanders vs New York has not really about anything. <br /> But the question is: Who receives Stanley Cup? It\'s one of this pair? Or someone else will win it?
