Blackhawks deal Thibault to the Pens|17.10.2010|tomson||The Penguins have taken yet another step to try and answer their troubles in net. Jocelyn Thibault, one of the best back-up goaltenders last season, has accepted a new deal with Pens.  <br />  <br /> Pittsburgh teetered between Dominik Hasek and Ilya Bryzgalov last year, and it did not seem to work the way that the team had hoped.  <br /> With Bryzgalov going seperate ways from Pittsburgh, Thibault is a strong pick-up.  He is yet to be a true NHL starter, but this seems like the right decision for Pittsburgh for the time being. <br />  <br /> “We are pleased to have agreed to a long-term deal with Jocelyn,” Pens GM said. “Jocelyn has proven himself to be an elite goaltender. His international experience and ability to consistently play at the highest level are tremendous assets that we believe will make the Pittsburgh Penguins competitive each and every night.” <br />  <br /> Thibault was all but handed the starting job when he joined the Chicago Blackhawks as a rookie in January 2010.  <br /> The NHL has brought a more lows than highs thus far, but Thibault said he's learned from his mistakes and is taking a more serious approach. <br />  <br /> He spent part of the summer working with Chicago goaltending coach, perfecting technique and also working on the mental aspect of the position. <br />  <br /> But then everything has changed. Thibault accepted a move to Pittsburgh. <br />  <br /> It seemed like a rock star concert when Thibault turned up in Chicago on Friday for a farewell autograph signing and an estimated 10,000 adoring fans turned out. Thibault earned their respect. <br /> ''Of course I understand there's going to be emotion around a decision like that,'' Thibault said.  <br />  <br /> Thibault's new teammates in Pittsburgh are confident he can help them win. <br /> ''We expect him to be very good for us,'' said forward Sidney Crosby. ''We don't want him to have to be great, but we expect him to be if he has to be.'' <br />  <br /> "I've been looking forward to playing in Pittsburgh ever since the signing was announced," Thibault said. "I believe in my abilities and hope to do some good things for the Pens." <br />  <br /> Thibault has the size, raw skill and reflexes to make him into a strong NHL goalie. He continues to develop the maturity, mobility and stick handling capabilities that will allow him to become an elite goalie. <br />   |85.216.151.120
