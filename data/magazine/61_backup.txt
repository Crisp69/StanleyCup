Halak keeps the Pens up|11.10.2012|tomson||There’s been lots of talk all the pre-season as to who the Pens should start come the season time.  <br />  <br /> Jocelyn Thibault may lead the Pens all-time statistics in nearly every important category but don’t be fooled, Jaroslav Halak is the guy. <br />  <br /> It’s hard to argue Halak hasn’t earned the right to be the guy once the season rolled around. Afterall he’s put together his best numbers so far and has been among the best at his position since the start of the league. <br />  <br /> However, there is comfort in knowing even Brian Boucher, Pens No. 3 between the pipes, is available if needed. What Boucher has done last weekend confirmed what the team already knew. He’s a true professional who takes care of his business off the ice and maintains a level of preparation you would expect from a top goaltender.  <br />  <br /> To sit on the bench for long stretches and perform in the fashion he has is among the mot difficult things to do in hockey. His 16 saves in 4:1 victory against Anaheim Ducks on Saturday have reminded everybody in the organization just what he’s capable of doing. <br />  <br /> Boucher wants to play but he also understands the situation. He was signed as a backup and Halak hasn’t done anything to alter the thinking inside the organization. <br />  <br /> Boucher has done more than his share in a supporting role but the Penguins will ride Halak as far as he can take them. It’s a lot easier going to your #2 than it is to turn to your #1.  <br />  <br /> Halak is third overall in save %, sits seventh in GAA and is tied for eleventh with one shutout. <br />  <br /> Boucher still needs to prove his skills on a long-term level. However Pens never entered the season with as few goals allowed as this year. And in this case all the credit goes to the men behind the masks. |195.146.141.80
