Selanne set for Penguin debut|07.04.2010|tomson||Right wing Teemu Selanne is scheduled to be in the Penguins’ lineup for Saturday´s game against St. Louis Blues after signing a two-year contract earlier in the day. <br />  <br /> “This is the only place I wanted to play,” Selanne said in a statement released by the Penguins. “They have great owners, great fans and a chance to secure the play-off berth. This team is hungry and ready to go.” <br />  <br /> Selanne could have signed long ago, for far more money, with any number of other teams, but Selanne made it clear where he belongs to. Pittsburgh. <br />  <br /> The Pens should thank their lucky stars for just the latest “hometown discount” given by Selanne, who received a no-trade clause in the deal. <br />  <br /> “We’re happy to have Teemu in the squad and thank him for his patience as we sorted out our salary-cap situation,” Pittsburgh´s general manager said.  <br />  <br /> At 23, the blazing speed of the Finnish Flash has been glaringly evident through the first practice with Pens. "He can make any team a real contender," Penguins´ center Sidney Crosby said.  <br />  <br /> "We’re all going to have the pleasure of watching Selanne in a Penguins uniform, and that treat should not be taken lightly," Crosby added. "Selanne’s famous No. 8 will someday definitely rise to the Mellon Arena rafters." |85.216.151.120
