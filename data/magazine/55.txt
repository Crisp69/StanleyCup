SC 28 PREVIEW - WESTERN CONFERENCE|03.10.2011|tomson||Yet another season begins in few days and there are again more questions than answers. Will Hurricanes defend their first ever Stanley Cup title? Can Ottawa win at least one game in regular season? And who will be once again knocked-out in the first play-off round? It´s that time of year again – pre-season prediction time.  <br />  <br /> Let´s have a look on the order of team finishes, in both conferences, for the upcoming regular season. The decisions were based on last season rankings, progress made since then and off-season changes in teams. But as it goes in sports, all might look completely different in three months time from now.  <br />  <br /> 1.) <b>Colorado Avalanche</b> (1st, Northwest Division) <br /> -It’s amazing to think of the past decade of dominance the Avalanche have had throughout the regular season, and much of the credit goes to manager sollu. Colorado will be one of the toughest cities to visit and escape with two points, but the Avalanche have so many question marks up front they look like a team that will have to rely on goaltending. Just to remind you, Oscar Maudlin is coming off an epic 6 shot-outs season. <br />  <br /> 2.) <b>San Jose Sharks</b> (1st, Pacific Division) <br /> - The defending Pacific division winner, despite their inability to cash in in the playoffs, are a good bet to repeat as division champs after a season of little roster turnover. Sharks might be the biggest thread to Colorado and Detroit on their way to the Stanley Cup finals. Look for an ambitious bench boss Earlt to have his troops better prepared for the play-offs than ever. <br />  <br /> 3.) <b>Detroit Red Wings</b> (1st, Central Division) <br /> - After falling short of the Stanley Cup last season, look for the powerful Red Wings to keep their foot on the gas and win the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl again this season. Detroit's depth up front is impressive. A balanced blend of old(er) and new, the Red Wings feature proven vets, peaking players, and promising prospects at every end of the ice – except perhaps in net. That makes this team a serious contender once again.  <br />  <br /> 4.) <b>St. Louis Blues</b>  <br /> -The Blues rolled down the stretch last season to take over the top seed in the Central Division, but regular seasons´ titles only looks good in the stat books. It’s time for Servac Lipiansky to lead his team to the promised land instead of just regular season success. If things go well, it could be the beginning of a new dynasty in the tournament. <br />  <br /> 5.) <b>Minnesota Wild</b>  <br /> -The Wild front office has done a tremendous job rebuilding this team since their only division title in season 8. New manager Flaherty brought the franchise to the play-offs twice and aims even higher. Team captain Ivan Kriko had a tremendous rebound season and goalie Yuriy Baskakov burst onto the scene and rivaled the other premiere goaltenders in the league. Another play-off appearance is a must-be. <br />  <br /> 6.) <b>Chicago Black Hawks</b>  <br /> - Three seasons ago, when manager furmint took over the franchise, the Black Hawks were coming off a run to the Conference final and were pegged as contenders for the Cup. Injuries, among other things, hit the team in key positions and Chicago never got its act together. However, all the parts that made this team a threat are still in place and they’re hungry for redemption. <br />  <br /> 7.) <b>Nashville Predators</b> <br /> - Make no mistake they are still the class of the division, but Columbus did the best at closing the gap. They lost Patrik Kocis but re-signed Johan Legendre in a smart move. This is a tremendously deep team that should have a solid regular season once again. But expect another early playoff exit. <br />  <br /> 8.) <b>Los Angeles Kings</b>  <br /> - Full of so much future firepower and home to the deepest core of prospects in the league, the Kings are popular dark horse pick year in and year out. The problem is, the Western Conference is stacked with playoff-worthy teams, so the Kings are having a hard time navigating a winning season. But it will come. <br />  <br /> 9.) <b>Columbus Blue Jackets</b>  <br /> -Not long ago, Columbus was an aging team facing considerable vets replacing problems. Luckily for Blue Jackets fans, the deft work of GM Lord Stanley steered them out of that misery and back into the West’s upper echelon. Defense may be a concern, but if goalie Larry Smith and center Jensen Gridelet continue the dominance they demonstrated last season, look out! <br />  <br /> 10.)<b>Edmonton Oilers</b>  <br /> -Surprise! The Oilers will come out of nowhere to grab the 10th seed in the Western Conference, thanks in large part to one of the most promises defense in the Western Conference. The offense turns out to be quite mediocre, a large step-up from previous season. The new addition to the team in Loic Schalch and Herman Autti makes Oilers a dark horse in the race for play-off seed. <br />  <br /> 11.) <b>Anaheim Ducks</b>  <br /> - After an eleven-season run as a constant play-off maker, a changing of the guard is set to take place. Anaheim still boasts perhaps the league’s deepest lineup up front, but you can’t lose the likes of Roberto Escher and Viktor Teliev without taking a hit. Ducks also gave up the promising youngster Into Syrjävaara. That said, another 10+ points season is in the cards. <br />  <br /> 12.) <b>Calgary Flames</b>  <br /> - With a strong youth core, veteran presence and a best ever third division seed under manager GloboX, the Flames are on the verge of something special. However, it is common for teams built around kids to take at least a little step back after a season of exceeding expectations. The Flames will be a challenge, but the Western Conference is a beast. <br />  <br /> 13.) <b>Phoenix Coyotes</b>  <br /> -Some believe Ivars Lubans may not have been sold if the Phoenix wants to build a Stanley Cup-contending team this season. Management’s off-season rebuilding of the roster rendered that option moot and also severely hampered the Yotes’ hopes at a playoff berth. They’ll need at least a couple of seasons to hope to regain past glories. <br />  <br /> 14.)<b>Dallas Stars</b>  <br /> -Quick, name a player on the Stars other than captain Brian Orset or alternate Manuel Pruvost. No? I didn’t think so. Dallas has somehow quickly become an old team and they don’t have the young talent to make up the difference. Time to blow up the roster of a team that made 10 playoff appearances including 4 Conference finals, but remains outside the play-offs for seven straight seasons under manager Pescalune. <br />  <br /> 15.) <b>Vancouver Canucks</b> <br /> - There's pretty much zero expectations on this team, and that's probably a good thing. Nucks just got a new manager last season and his first year in Vancouver isn’t going to be a memorable one. The good news is, PrabRai09 brought some new players in and fans are getting excited for the hockey they will witness this season. The bad news is, the hockey they will witness will be exciting in a physical fashion, not a game-breaking one. |89.173.80.100
