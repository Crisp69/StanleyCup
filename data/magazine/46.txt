Pens inked Vladimir Konstantinov|09.06.2010|tomson||The Pens have inked russian defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov, who has been with the team on a try-out basis over the course of training camp. Konstantinov, 22, had an exceptional performance during the pre-season, and is a great addition to the team as an eighth defenseman. <br />  <br /> Obviously rookie blueliners Jan Hejda and Vladdie Konstantinov have made the team as the seventh and eighth defensemen, so that leaves Petr Svoboda being the spare.  <br />  <br /> "I was impressed with Vladimir's ability to make the outlet pass in the exhibition games, and in the way that he uses his large frame to close up the middle," Pens GM said. <br />  <br /> No specific details on the terms have been released just yet, but it is believed to be something a bit higher than $100,000 per day. Pittsburgh paid 32 millions for young russian talent. <br />  <br /> "He appears to be a solid d-man, just like Orr.  It’s doubtful that he can do all the same things Orr did, but he’ll get the job done," Pens captain Mario Lemieux said. <br />  <br /> He’s also a nice addition for the fact that he’s a defensive-minded d-man.  The Penguins have their fare share of shooters from the blue line in Sergey Gonchar, Andrey Markov and Sami Salo.  Adding a third, shutdown-type guy help even out the equation. |85.248.70.251
