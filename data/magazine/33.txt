Avs claim 2-1 win over Pens|09.01.2010|tomson|<img class="magazine" align="left" width="300 px" alt="picture" title="Avs claim 2-1 win over Pens" src="http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2009/1203/nhl_g_pens-avs12_576.jpg">|Karlis Ribenis's outstanding performance highlighted a 2-1 win for the Colorado Avalanche over the visiting Pittsburgh Penguins on Friday.  <br />  <br /> Colorado netminder Ribenis stopped 21 of 22 shots in more than 55 minutes of work while Pittsburgh's Ilya Bryzgalov gave up two goals on the 30 shots he faced. <br />  <br /> Avs held off the Pens 2-1 in a game notable for the chippiness between the non-conference opponents. Ribenis was within 4 minutes of shutout before Mario Lemieux scored for the Pens. <br />  <br /> 'We've got to find a way to bury the puck,' Penguins coach said. 'We kept coming after them, especially in the second and third period. We just couldn't pull it behind them today.' <br />  <br /> The game featured 16 penalty minutes - including 10 in a combative third period. <br />  <br /> 'Playing that kind of game is tiring,' Sidney Crosby quipped. <br />  <br /> Schwarz scored 3:43 into the last period on a brilliant individual effort. With the 'Avs on a power play, he took a puck in his zone, skated by a turned-around Gonchar between the hash marks and slipped a backhand past Ilya Bryzgalov. <br />  <br /> Sramko made it 2-0 just 1:54 minutes later, skating down the right side, faking a slap shot and instead sneaking a wrist shot past Bryzgalov.  <br />  <br /> Pens did light a lamp behind ColoradoÂ´s goalie just once. Lemieux received a pass from Ilya Kovalchuk on a 2-on-1, made a quick deke before sending a backhand to the back of the net off the blocker of Avalanche goaltender Karlis Ribenis. |85.216.151.120
