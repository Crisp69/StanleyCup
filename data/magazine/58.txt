Expendables are ready to go|09.12.2011|petrik 2.0||Exactly 1 week before their first match in Stanley Cup Tournament, Vancouver Canucks organized a press conference with the intention to introduce the new team for the 29th season to the public. GM petrik was available to media, ready to answer eager questions of gathered reporters. Here are the answers: <br />  <br /> <b>Q: petrik, What forced you to return from retirement after such a long time?</b> <br /> <i>petrik: Forced? Nothing forced me. To tell you the truth, I got a bit bored. So I just came back to try to have a little fun. So far, it is working, I enjoy every moment of this comeback. I was a bit lucky too, that there was one free team in the Stanley Cup and that sollu was so kind and allowed me back into the tournament.</i> <br />  <br /> <b>Q: How does it feel to be back?</b>  <br /> <i>petrik: As I said, so far I enjoy it. I do not regret my decision to come back at all and I am looking forward to plenty of fun once the season starts.</i> <br />  <br /> <b>Q: Did you already have time to acquaint yourself with the current state of this tournament?</b> <br /> <i>petrik: I believe the system of the tournament didn´t change. I also noticed that some veterans of this tournament, who were playing here during my first stint more than 10 seasons ago, are still here. to name a few: tomson, Trsto, cPalo, Poliku... I can´t wait to beat the sh*t out of them :) </i>  <br />  <br /> <b>Q: Right after sollu accepted you back into the tournament, you tried to switch Canucks for some other team. Apparently, you did not succeed. Do you want to add something more to this?</b> <br /> <i>petrik: I tried to contact current managers of my previous Stanley Cup teams (Chicago and St.Louis) and also couple of other teams, but nobody showed interest in switching their teams for the Canucks, so I gave up. It is official now, that Vancouver Canucks will become my third Stanley Cup Team, at least for the immediate future.</i> <br />  <br /> <b>Q: What are your goals for the upcoming Stanley Cup season?</b> <br /> <i>petrik: To win the Stanley cup of course! just kidding :)  <br /> To have as much fun as possible. Look, I don´t use to wear pink glasses. 22 days ago, this team didn´t even exist. With the team built in such a short time and with such limited amount of money, our expectations can hardly be high. We want to be as difficult to play against as possible, and we will see what we can achieve with that. Maybe we will manage to catch some opponents by surprise. We are the hockey version of “The Expendables“ movie - most of our players were “expendable“, not needed by their former team and their value on the open market was as low as possible. They take this opportunity as a fresh start, as their one last chance to prove they can play hockey too. They are a very eager and determined group, and I am looking forward to see them show this determination on the ice. Everybody would be wise to not underestimate us.</i> |80.250.252.38
