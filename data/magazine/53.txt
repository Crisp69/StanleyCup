Pens acquired left wing Igor Liba|14.08.2011|tomson|<img class="magazine" align="left" width="100 px" alt="picture" title="Pens acquired left wing Igor Liba" src="http://img.hokej.cz/files/hraci/l/liba_igor/liba_igor3.jpg">|The Pittsburgh Penguins have an asset they haven't had since the Mario Lemieux era, and that is a legitimate, talented and highly-touted forward.  <br />  <br /> None other than 20-year old Slovak native Igor Liba, a subject to many trade rumours over the past season, agreed to sign a long-term deal to play at Consol Energy Center. That comes with a full No Movement Clause. <br />  <br /> “This is a deal that will definitely make us a better team,” Penguins general manager said. Liba seems to be a perfect fit. The team has good two-way wingers (Krejci, Elias, Satan), but those players are young, inexperienced, and they're not exactly 1st line caliber players.  <br />  <br /> They were playing against tougher defensive units than they should have been, which is one of the explanations for the lack of consistency the Penguins displayed over the course of the season. Liba might help with that issue.  <br />  <br /> This signing affects the team on so many levels. “Liba is a young, scoring winger who is exactly the type of player we were looking for,” captain Mario Lemieux said.  <br />  <br /> “He is 20 years old and has averaged about a point a game. His numbers have improved every season and he definitely will help our goal scoring,” Lemieux added. <br />  <br /> Liba never mentioned money during the conference call to announce his signing Sunday. According to GM, he accepted less money than other teams were offering. <br />  <br /> But Liba and the Pens seemed like a perfect match going all the way back to the trade deadline. The Penguins needed a No. 1 winger who could run their second-unit power play. <br />  <br /> Consol Energy Center is routinely sold out, and there's no doubting Pittsburgh has some of the most passionate and loyal fans in hockey. <br />  <br /> \"When you factor that all in together, it kind of shows me this is the right fit for me,\" said Igor Liba, a winger with great hands and dazzling moves. <br />  <br /> Liba said he understands the pressures that are associated with signing a big contract in a major market like Pittsburgh. <br />  <br /> \"It's going to be a challenge for sure,\" he said. \"It's going to be something different. I haven't experienced it, but if you want to be a good player or a great player that's something you should relish. What better place to try to perform every night than Consol Energy? That's a dream come true.\" |89.173.80.100
