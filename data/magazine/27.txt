Colorado lost season opener against division rival Vancouver Canucks, but surprisingly won both following games against Columbus and Dallas scoring 9 goals in total. Young Avalanche is currently at seventh place in the Conference. The Northwest division seems to be the toughest division once again with 4 teams in TOP8 in the West. There are some players on the team who remember the days of glory, now they are hungry for any kind of success. And playoffs are not out of reach so far this season.  <br />  <br />  <br /> Colorado Captian defender Ľubomír Rajčan earned 3 points in 2 game as he missed the opener against Vancouver. He says that the AVS could be even better at this time in the standings if he and snipper Roman Haluška would play all games. Haluška scored 4 goals and added 1 asist in games against Blue Jackets and Dallas while he also missed the game against Vancouver. They both believe that this time Colorado can finaly manage to get to the playoffs after long time of struggling. Center Richard Groves says that the AVS need to to focus on little things and find the will to win big games, and with some luck and courage, they can surprise almost everybody. And they still have at least goalie Šmíd to count on at the end... |85.216.253.148
