I am dissapointed, but I have to admit that Stars deserved to advance more than us.</i> <br />  <br /> Stars will try to reach their first ever SC final in the best of two series against Hawks division rival St.Louis Blues this weekend. Blues cruised to the Conference finals past Minnesota Wild with suprising ease, beating them 10-3 and 8-1, and they are expected to swept the Stars likewise in their route for the Stanley Cup. |87.244.196.218
