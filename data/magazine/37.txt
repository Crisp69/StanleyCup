Hawks under new management|15.01.2010|AVS-MAN||Tonight starts a new age of Blackhawks history. New manager AVS-MAN is the third manager of the franchise history. It is a big challenge to take the team with successful and rich history. Managers chorche and petrik are big concepts.  <br /> Few words from new manager: <br /> ,,I am looking forward to this season. Our action in Columbus was not lucky. But we were working with young players in that seasons, so the results couldnt be miraculous. Tonights opener with Isles will be a big performance and I hope, that a lot of fans will come. Chicago is typical hockey town in contrast of Columbus. So Lets roll.\" <br /> Team presented new jerseys on the team-web (for home games will Hawks wear the Red set). We also hired new stuff: Jeff Hackett became a goalie coach and Claude Lemieux was hired as a physical condition coach. <br /> Our plan is clear: We want to be a dignified opponent and reach one of the play-off spots. |80.250.18.49
