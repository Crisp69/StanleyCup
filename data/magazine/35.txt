SC 19 PREVIEW - EASTERN CONFERENCE|14.01.2010|petrik|<img class="magazine" align="left" width="200 px" alt="picture" title="SC 19 PREVIEW - EASTERN CONFERENCE" src="http://www.spihl.net/images/eastern_conf_logo.gif">|1. <b>FLORIDA PANTHERS</b> – defending Stanley Cup champion is the top favourite for the conference throne yet again <br />  <br /> 2. <b>PHILADELPHIA FLYERS</b> – led by german national team star Timo Dil and experienced manager peeha, Flyers should be the biggest thread to Panthers on their way to SC finals <br />  <br /> 3. <b>BOSTON BRUINS</b> – Bruins should be able to win probably the weakest division in the tournament and so secure spot #3 for the playoffs. <br />  <br /> 4. <b>WASHINGTON CAPITALS</b> – Caps are experienced enough to secure a playoff spot well before the last regular season game <br />  <br /> 5. <b>ATLANTA THRASHERS</b> – Trashers should be able to repeat last seasons 6th place, maybe even upgrade it a little <br />  <br /> 6. <b>TAMPA BAY LIGHTNING</b> – Bolts will be a real thread in the east – but that is still at least a season or two away. Manager roman99 is experienced enough, but you cannot tell that about most of his players yet and in the tough southeast division that can be the difference maker. <br />  <br /> 7. <b>NEW YORK RANGERS</b> – despite young goalie, Rangers are not expected to repeat last season failure. Playoff is reachable <br />  <br /> 8. <b>TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS</b> – weak division should help the Leafs to slip into the playoffs for the first time under manager acapone <br />  <br /> 9. <b>MONTREAL CANADIENS</b> – possible addition of one or two players can make the difference between making and not making the playoffs for the Habs <br />  <br /> 10. <b>CAROLINA HURRICANES</b> – Canes are significantly limited by the division they are playing in, playoff would be considered as a unexpected suprise <br />  <br /> 11. <b>PITTSBURGH PENGUINS</b> – Admirable team full of famous names is not expected to make big noise in the conference standings in their return to the tournament after 2 yrs break <br />  <br /> 12. <b>BUFFALO SABRES</b> – in 11 years under manager jAc, Sabres best results are two 8th place finishes and they will hardly step out of their shadow this year <br />  <br /> 13. <b>NEW YORK ISLANDERS</b> – it will be a tough start for the new islanders manager fkv, as his team is just not quality enough to challenge the better teams of the conference <br />  <br /> 14. <b>NEW JERSEY DEVILS</b> – once a dominating force in the tournament, Trsto´s team is going through grand rebuilding process and it will take some time before they can hope for better finish with their new young generation of future stars <br />  <br /> 15. <b>OTTAWA SENATORS</b> – champions from 2 seasons ago are taking the same rebuilding path as Devils, and will most probably accompany them at the bottom of conference standings this year |80.250.252.38
