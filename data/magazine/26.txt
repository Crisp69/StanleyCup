Season, that is supposed to be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"the first step on the long road to succes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", according to manager petrik´s press conference prior to the opening game against the long time rivals from St.Louis. <br />  <br /> <i>we have discussed our possibilities for months, and at the end we all agreed that if we wanted to stay competitive long term, we have to take the painful road of rebuilding. thats why we parted with some fan favourite veterans and leaders, and acquire the group of new young players that we are very excited about. we believe that within 2-3 years we can be back where we belong - among the best teams in the league.</i> petrik said at the press conference. <br />  <br /> but not all familiar faces are gone from the opening night lineup. Maurice Richard trophy winner from last season and team captain Oskar Zahorec is ready to lead his new young teammates both on and off the ice. veteran goalie Alfréd Čvirik is also ready to begin his 20th season with the club. some of his new teammates were not even born when he was beggining his professional career. <br />  <br /> despite the lost of some key players, Hawks are not ready to give up voluntarily. Captain Zahorec spoke for the whole team and this is their message to the fans and oponents: <i>we probably won´t be considered the favourites before many games this season, but we will try to do our best every night and see what we can achieve with that. nobody will take 2 points from us for free.</i> |80.250.252.38
