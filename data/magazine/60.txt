Pens bolster offense by signing James Neal|08.01.2012|tomson||Pittsburgh head coach and GM is planning on giving his team every possible chance to make a run at the Stanley Cup this year. Earlier this week, he added a big, talented young forward James Neal in a long-awaited deal. <br />  <br /> Neal brings a power forward presence to the Pens that they have missed since Peter Bondra left the franchise. Clearly the Pens' needs were up front, where they have been decimated by departs, most notably of Bondra and Dvorak. <br />  <br /> What GM managed to avoid in this deal was giving up young assets for a rental player. Neal was an ideal choice for Pens. Both an A-class player and also an affordable asset. <br />  <br /> There's not many of these power guys in the game. „And Neal, on our list is one of the better ones in the game and has got some room to grow. That's why when you can get a guy like Neal, the opportunity might not be there again," said GM during a conference call. <br />  <br /> "Anytime you sign some players you are trying to make your hockey club better," general manager said. "I think when you add a guy like Neal, it really improves your offense. He's a two-way winger that is really going to help getting the puck in the net area. He is a smart player. I think that's been a big need for us." <br />  <br /> It appears that the Pens aren’t quite done yet. According to the front office staff, the Pens are in the market for a defensemen and a solid sniper. |89.173.80.100
