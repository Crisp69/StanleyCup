SEASON PREDICTIONS vs. REALITY - WESTERN CONFERENCE|09.02.2010|petrik||<b>PACIFIC DIVISION</b> <br /> surprising leader of the western conference is from even more surprising division. Stars (9th vs. 1st) are perfect so far, winning all 9 games in impressive way. hat off and my apologize to manager davben for underestimating him in my pre-season predictions. my pre-season favourite for pacific throne - Ducks (3rd vs. 6th) - recorded also solid 14 points so far. Sharks (12th vs. 9th) are still battling for the PO spot while Kings (13th vs. 14th) and Coyotes (14th vs. 15th) are almost exactly where I predicted them to be, at the bottom of the conference standings. <br />  <br /> <b>CENTRAL DIVISION</b> <br /> Predators (4th vs. 2nd) and Blue Jackets (2nd vs. 4th) are leading the division es expected, with respectable 8 wins in 9 games each. Blues (7th vs. 8th) are holding the final playoff spot so far with 11 points. Hawks (10th vs. 12th) are 3 points and 4 places behind, while Red Wings (6th vs. 13th) are so dissapointing so far, that they even fail to win the \"biggest dissapointment of the west\" title (will be awarded a couple of rows lower) <br />  <br /> <b>NORTHWEST DIVISION</b> <br /> you have to be kidding me. at least that is what IÂ´m still thinking about the Avalanche season so far. but Avs (11th vs. 3rd) have proved to me with win after win (8 so far and counting) that they indeed are for real. hat off to you too sollu. <br /> only Canucks (8th vs. 5th), who are also doing better than I expected, managed to keep the pace and won 8 of 9 games of their own.  <br /> Oilers (5th vs. 7th) got themselves going after slower start, winning 6 of their last 7 games.  <br /> and now for the \"biggest dissapointment of the west\" title mentioned above. the unquestionable winners are Flames (1st vs. 10th). pre-season favourite will have to fight hardly for at least making the playoffs. <br /> on the other side, Wild (15th vs. 11th) are one of the pleasant surprises for me so far, winning the same number of games as Flames. |80.250.252.38
