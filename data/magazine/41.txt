SEASON PREDICTIONS vs. REALITY - EASTERN CONFERENCE|09.02.2010|petrik||with just 4 games left in the regular season, I decided to check how the teams are doing compared to my pre-season predictions. I will start in the east: <br />  <br /> <b>NORTHEAST DIVISION</b> <br /> no suprises here. Bruins (predicted to finish 3rd in the East, currently 1st) are dominating their division, while Habs (predicted 9th, currently 7th) and Leafs (8th vs. 10th) are separated by just 1 point, battling on the edge of playoff spots. Sabres (13th vs. 12th) will probably miss the playoffs to probably nobodyÂ´s surprise and Seantors are right where they were expected - dead last, on 15th place. <br />  <br /> <b>SOUTHEAST DIVISION</b> <br /> Another good point for me, predictions are pretty accurate so far. Panthers (1st vs. 2nd) leads the division, with Thrashers (5th vs. 4th) and Capitals (4th vs. 5th) close behind (maybe even little closer than I expected). Bolts are 4th southeast team in the top 6 teams of the East, holding the 6th place exactly as I predicted them to. Canes I also expected to struggle, but not as much as they do (12th vs. 14th place, still without a point) <br />  <br /> <b>ATLANTIC DIVISION</b> <br /> Finaly something unexpected here. Rangers (7th vs. 3rd) managed to get 9 points in as many games. that alone is not as much surprising as the fact that those 9 points are enoug for a comfortable lead in Atlantic division, 3 points ahead of struggling Flyers (2nd vs. 8th) who managed to win just 2 games so far and are in real danger of missing the playoffs for the 1st time in 7 yrs. Pens (11th vs. 9th) are just 1 point behind and so are Islanders (13th vs. 11th). Devils (14th vs. 12th) with their young team could hardly hoped for more than 3 points they got so far (for me, even those 3 pts are cca 3 times more than I expected) |80.250.252.38
