We had a great season. Nobody expected from us that after winning Division title, we can reach the Conference final, where we were unfortunately beaten by later Stanley cup winner New Jersey Devils. I think it was great success for our team . . .  <br />  <br /> <u>moderator</u> : Let's talk about current season, you are on the top of Northeast division and also Eastern conference and after first half you are still unbeaten. How do you see your position after full regular season and what are your ambitions? <br />  <br /> <u>Dobroslav</u> : Well, it is hard to say, because there are still 6 games left to finish it. We had very good start that's true and when we continue in our performance we can hold our current position and maybe attack the President Trophy. But there are many teams with same ambitions like Calgary, Dallas or St. Louis, managed by hogy, which is from my point of view the biggest favorite to win the Stanley Cup this season. Fortunately, we can met only in Stanley cup final :) And our ambitions? I would lie if I said not to win the cup, so we will do our best to manage it, but it will be hard and long journey. Comparing the team from this season and the last one, we lost Bohus Hriadel, one of the greatest snipper of NHL and all hockey world, who was sold at the end of last season. Also we have new first goalie Armands LatvƒÅnis, young, perspective, potential goalie of Latvia national team in the future, who despite his age proves his qualities not only in NHL. But he still needs some time to grow. On the other side, the rest of the team is almost unchanged, so technically we are in the same strength as from last season.  <br />  <br /> <u>moderator</u> : My last question for now, is there anything you would like to address to managers of other teams? <br />  <br /> <u>Dobroslav</u> : Nothing special, only to wish a good luck to everybody who is member of this Stanley Cup ride . . . |195.212.29.179
