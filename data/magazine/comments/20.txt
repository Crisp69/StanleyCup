Judging by our history my team will soon play golf  <img src="img/ico/wink.gif">  <br />  <br /> Anyway, I should be satisfied as this is my best SCT season so far (I suppose). I want to congratulate to winners of West and East - Blues and Flyers! <br />  <br />  <img src="img/ico/smile.gif">  |82.192.60.60
00:02:06 18.05.2009|sollu|- Young Avalanche managed to get some points, even win a game and not just one but twice. 0 points would be less surprising for sure...  <br />  <br />  <br /> to be honest - they won both games while i was away, it is not my fault  <img src="img/ico/laugh.gif">  |85.216.224.139
