Visnovsky to wear Pens uniform|27.08.2010|tomson||The Pittsburgh Penguins power play is about to get a big boost from the backend as they have acquired Lubomir Visnovsky. <br />  <br /> With the heat on to make further headway in the Stanley Cup playoff race in the NHL’s Eastern Conference, the Pens will open a set of games on Saturday against the Calgary Flames. <br />  <br /> With the Pens set to also face the Nashville Predators on Sunday, the coaching staff has been busy trying to put some new pieces in place. <br />  <br /> Rookie defensemen Lubomir Visnovsky will play his first game in Pens uniform against the Flames. He will probably appear next to Finish veteran blueliner Sami Salo.  <br />  <br /> “There is some inkling they will probably play together,” said Pens coach, who has been toying with various potential even-strength, blue-line combinations. <br />  <br /> Visnovsky and Sergey Gonchar, who along with youngster Jan Hejda are the only left-shot defensemen among Pittsburgh’s eight, are likely to play with different partners at different times, coach said. <br />  <br /> The 19-year old Slovakian newcomer is also being counted on to provide a special-teams boost, on the top power-play unit. <br />  <br /> \\\"Lubomir Visnovsky is a skilled defenseman with a proven track record,\\\" said Penguins' General Manager in a statement. \\\"We feel this is a major addition for us, not only for our stretch drive but going forward.\\\" <br />  <br /> Visnovsky is a smooth skating powerplay specialist who makes a solid first past out of the zone, however due to his relatively small stature, he has been a bit injury prone throughout his junior career. |85.248.70.251
