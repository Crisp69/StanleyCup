Wayne Gretzky signed with Pens|17.01.2011|tomson||Canadian hockey legend Wayne Gretzky has finally become a Penguin.  <br />  <br /> The Pittsburgh Penguins acquired Gretzky in a megadeal that stands for one of tomsonÂ´s most aggressive moves in his storied history as Penguins GM.  <br />  <br /> "To be able to acquire a player of Wayne's stature is a rarity in this business," said tomson, the Pens head coach and general manager.  <br />  <br /> "He has proven over his junior career that he is one of the top players in the world and we are looking forward to seeing him bring his elite play to Pittsburgh."  <br />  <br /> Gretzky is expected to make his debut in Penguins black&gold on Saturday against the Islanders in New York.  <br />  <br /> The deal between the two clubs has been on-again, off-again for weeks. When asked about the possibility of signing Wayne Gretzky, Pittsburgh GM said he would entertain the notion but he said he did not expect to be in the vanguard of a bidding war. <br />  <br /> Earlier this month, general manager of the Penguins revealed the talks with Gretzky's agent about future salary for Gretzky. Today the Pens resumed their bidding for talented center. <br />  <br /> Under the terms of this deal, the Pens paid 130 million for the latest addition to the team.  <br />  <br /> "Everyone knows that given Gretzky's talent, if he's put in the right situation with the right people around him, I don't think there's anybody that can argue that he can't help a team," Hockey Night in Canada analyst told Pittsburgh Gazette.  <br />  <br /> Gretzky will join his friend Mark Messier in Pens squad, his teammate when they were teen-agers with Edmonton. <br />  <br /> With the 24-year-old Messier presumably continuing as third-line center for the Penguins, Gretzky will probably assume fourth-line duties at the position, limiting his ice time and the demand on his physical resources during the season campaign. <br />  <br /> One question involves his potential linemates. <br />  <br /> A logical left wing for Gretzky would be Patrik Elias, who joined the Pens this season in a recent trade. <br />  <br /> Part of Elias's problem was the lack of a full-time center alongside him who could consistently create scoring opportunities that best utilize Elias's finishing skills.  <br />  <br /> Joe Sakic, who spent the whole season as a center, would move to right-wing, leaving a post to Gretzky. <br />  <br /> Gretzky, who will wear his 99 even on Pens jersey, was excited over the move.  <br />  <br /> "The Pens asked me if I'd like to play in Pittsburgh," Gretzky, 18, said late last night at a news conference. "I told them I'd love to play in Pittsburgh. They wanted me. They're excited to get me. I'm thrilled to be there." <br />  <br /> "We felt Wayne was a player who could come and fill the need that we felt we had for an explosive scorer and someone who could add a different dimension to our power play with the type of shot," Pens GM said.  <br />  <br /> "The power that he brings; he is a player maker, he has hockey sense and he knows how to make other people around him better," GM added. "You can tell by the assists he gets. I am sure every one of you has seen him play. What he brings, he can do things a lot of people can't do." <br />  <br /> Pens head coach doesn't expect Gretzky will have a problem fitting into the Penguins' team system. <br />  <br /> The name Gretzky and the nickname the Great One are familiar to even the most casual sports fans. His deeds in Pittsburgh, successful or not, will be difficult to ignore. <br />  <br /> The Penguins' roster was bolstered in the last few weeks with the acquistitions of forwards Patrik Elias and Alexander Ovechkin. Pens also acquired a goalie prospect Jaroslav Halak. |195.146.141.80
