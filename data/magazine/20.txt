Who would have thought...|17.05.2009|petrik||final games of SC 15 regular season are still left to play, but there is a handfull of things that we lived to see this season which we already shall consider \"surprising\" (and with some of them, maybe word \"shocking\" would fit the status better) <br />  <br /> <i>- Philly holding the 1st overall spot two points ahead of 2nd place Panthers? WTF?!? this could be the all time most surprising Presidents Trophy winner of the whole SC history... <br />  <br /> - Young Avalanche managed to get some points, even win a game and not just one but twice. 0 points would be less surprising for sure... <br />  <br /> - Rangers and Thrashers battling for the final PO spot in the east. both these teams were expected to make the postseason without any problems, but one will change hockey for golf surprisingly soon... <br />  <br /> - Blue Jackets fighting for the division title after 12 games. hard fight for central division title was expected, but you can hardly say that about Columbus participating in it... <br />  <br /> - Sharks missing the playoffs. Defending pacific division champion from last two seasons failed to repeat previos good performances and will miss the postseason for the first time under manager Terzo</i> <br />  <br /> will we see more surprises in the Playoffs? time will show... |80.250.252.38
