Pens coach: The tighter the game, the better for us|04.01.2012|tomson||The Penguins have managed this season to surprise their fans with a strong 5-1-1 start, finishing out the unofficial first half first in the Atlantic Division and third in the Eastern Conference overall only 3 points out of top spot behind the Carolina Hurricanes. While happy, the GM tomson notes that his team has a long way to go yet. <br />  <br /> <b>Q: It looks like a great situation here, the Penguins are third in the East. You enjoying it as much as you thought you would?</b>  <br />  <br /> A: Oh yeah. It’s incredibly exciting. But the season isn’t over and we’re not in the playoffs yet, so I’m not taking anything for granted. <br />  <br /> <b>Q: What is the situation in the locker room? <br /> </b> <br /> A: We’ve taken pride in the last four games and playing our way of hockey and playing with this group of guys and it’s a real credit to the guys in the room. We get 5 wins going into the break. It’s good to relax a little bit and take a breather. It’s also nice to do it knowing you’ll be able to lean on your team know how we play and get some wins. <br />  <br /> <b>Q: Pittsburgh had to regain its fans base, but do you feel excitement starting to build now?</b>  <br />  <br /> A. Yeah, it’s taken some time. I think people are still a little cautious, but our crowds are getting better, there’s more enthusiasm in the building. <br />  <br /> <b>Q: What have been the keys to the good start?</b>  <br />  <br /> A: I think we've been fortunate to get some real good goaltending. Jocelyn Thibault has been very good for us. And even though he lost to Florida in the beginning of the season, he´s been a reliable goalie since. Our goaltending has helped us win some close games.  <br />  <br /> <b>Q: You managed to win couple of games by just that one goal. Any explanations for that?  <br /> </b>  <br /> A: If you go and take a look back at the 1-goal games that we’ve been in, we were in those games for last two weeks, maybe earlier than that. That mentality, you get used to it, you get to live in it. I think that we felt, just the stats say, if we could keep other teams under four goals we’d beat ‘em. They give you so few opporunities, the tighter that game was, the better it was for us. <br />  <br /> <b>Q: But it can´t be all just because of Thibault. Winning is about scoring, isn´t it? <br /> </b>  <br /> A: Indeed. Just look at Jan Hrdina, he scored almost in each game. But we've also been getting great contributions from guys like Miroslav Satan, Petr Sykora, Wayne Gretzky and Igor Liba. They aren't star players, but they've filled their different roles really well. They've helped take a little pressure off Ovi and Dats [Alexander Ovechkin and Pavel Datsyuk]. <br />  <br /> <b>Q: What do you think about the first few weeks of the season?</b>  <br />  <br /> A: The teams in this tournament are good. You can't relax. We had a two-goal lead in the third period against the Rangers on Sunday. They got a couple of quick chances and tied the game up. On most nights, there's just not a lot of difference between winning and losing. <br />  <br /> <b>Q: Which prospects have a chance to crack your roster in the near future?</b>  <br />  <br /> A: Well, we really liked how our recent acquisition, Michal Handzus, looked in training camp and his exhibition games. We signed him to a contract, but he still needs more time to prove himself as a core player. Erik Karlsson really surprised us in camp. In fact, he paired with Mike Green on a couple of occasions. He's another kid with good size. We also have Igor Liba, already a fourth-liner. He played well but we don't want to rush him, though. We just figure it's better to let him develop properly.  <br />  <br /> <b>Q: You are about to face a Stanley Cup champion Colorado Avalanche. Any thoughts on that?</b>  <br />  <br /> A: They’re gonna be a huge challenge. I even watched quite a few of their games and what an entertaining team they are. Obviously, they possess some of the best players in the game in Martin Demes or Robert Schwarz. With Demes you know what you’re gonna get every single shift, he’s a player that elevates his game when it matters most. It’s gonna be tough for us to shut them down but we’re gonna be up for it. |89.173.80.100
