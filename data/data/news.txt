Stanley Cup 17 ready to go|27/08/2009|First of all I would like to welcome you to 17th season of our tournament which starts tomorrow, than in next some more lines I would like to focus on some improvements of our tournament.<p>As some of you might noticed, we have a new web. Our old web (thanx for all the fun and rest in peace) was a little outdated, as it survived through seven Stanley Cup season and went through 2 huge code redesigns. First came <a href="sc.php?id=news.php&id_news=109">8 months ago</a> when I created a completely new source code of our web to give you detailed statistical infos about your players, teams, history...  After all the changes and improvements that were implemented since January, I felt that our old web simply is not able to handle it (one thing I hated most was the layout of front page with poll in the middle of news and a lot of wasted space on top).<p>Than last season I started to create live update but soon I realized that all data used in our web needs to be transformed to utf-8 formatting which is used by HA. And this was the moment when I when I felt that it is the right time to make something with the web. So here it is, I hope you like it :)<p>Thanx to manager Petrik from Chicago for help with tournament logo, again :)<p>Next change since Stanley Cup 17 is connected with our Stars of the weekend. Since introduced, it went through some changes, now its time to change it to Stars of the night, so top 3 players of the night will be awarded and a player with most selections will be given <a href="sc.php?id=awards.php&trophy=lester">Lester B. Pearson Trophy</a>.<hr>If you are still reading, I would like to remind you of some web features, which are used not so often, first all Stanley Cup managers can write their press news (team blog or whatever you want to call it) in our <a href="sc.php?id=magazine.php">magazine</a><p>Second all our players stats are sortable by column, all you have to do is to select something from the selection form and than you can sort your selection by any column (to know who is best or worst in +/- or asists...).<p>When browsing through schedule, you can use the team selector to view only your team and you can send challenges from the web by clicking home/away (read [challenge help] on top of schedule page)<p>(Almost) complete list of our web features is here <a href="sc.php?id=data/web.html">here</a>.<p>Good luck in season 17 ;)

Important: Tampa changed!!!|01/09/2009|Unfortunatelly we are forced to change Tampa in the tournament.

Stanley Cup 17 ready to go|27/08/2009|First of all I would like to welcome you to 17th season of our tournament which starts tomorrow, than in next some more lines I would like to focus on some improvements of our tournament.<p>As some of you might noticed, we have a new web. Our old web (thanx for all the fun and rest in peace) was a little outdated, as it survived through seven Stanley Cup season and went through 2 huge code redesigns. First came <a href="sc.php?id=news.php&id_news=109">8 months ago</a> when I created a completely new source code of our web to give you detailed statistical infos about your players, teams, history...  After all the changes and improvements that were implemented since January, I felt that our old web simply is not able to handle it (one thing I hated most was the layout of front page with poll in the middle of news and a lot of wasted space on top).<p>Than last season I started to create live update but soon I realized that all data used in our web needs to be transformed to utf-8 formatting which is used by HA. And this was the moment when I when I felt that it is the right time to make something with the web. So here it is, I hope you like it :)<p>Thanx to manager Petrik from Chicago for help with tournament logo, again :)<p>Next change since Stanley Cup 17 is connected with our Stars of the weekend. Since introduced, it went through some changes, now its time to change it to Stars of the night, so top 3 players of the night will be awarded and a player with most selections will be given <a href="sc.php?id=awards.php&trophy=lester">Lester B. Pearson Trophy</a>.<hr>If you are still reading, I would like to remind you of some web features, which are used not so often, first all Stanley Cup managers can write their press news (team blog or whatever you want to call it) in our <a href="sc.php?id=magazine.php">magazine</a><p>Second all our players stats are sortable by column, all you have to do is to select something from the selection form and than you can sort your selection by any column (to know who is best or worst in +/- or asists...).<p>When browsing through schedule, you can use the team selector to view only your team and you can send challenges from the web by clicking home/away (read [challenge help] on top of schedule page)<p>(Almost) complete list of our web features is here <a href="sc.php?id=data/web.html">here</a>.<p>Good luck in season 17 ;)

Stanley Cup finals series will be reduced to 2 played games (not 2 winning games like now).<p>Please let us know your opinion about this proposal, we will decided to change or not change the format after we go throught all your ideas and comments.||sollu|

Stanley Cup 17 ready to go|27/08/2009|First of all I would like to welcome you to 17th season of our tournament which starts tomorrow, than in next some more lines I would like to focus on some improvements of our tournament.<p>As some of you might noticed, we have a new web. Our old web (thanx for all the fun and rest in peace) was a little outdated, as it survived through seven Stanley Cup season and went through 2 huge code redesigns. First came <a href="sc.php?id=news.php&id_news=109">8 months ago</a> when I created a completely new source code of our web to give you detailed statistical infos about your players, teams, history...  After all the changes and improvements that were implemented since January, I felt that our old web simply is not able to handle it (one thing I hated most was the layout of front page with poll in the middle of news and a lot of wasted space on top).<p>Than last season I started to create live update but soon I realized that all data used in our web needs to be transformed to utf-8 formatting which is used by HA. And this was the moment when I when I felt that it is the right time to make something with the web. So here it is, I hope you like it :)<p>Thanx to manager Petrik from Chicago for help with tournament logo, again :)<p>Next change since Stanley Cup 17 is connected with our Stars of the weekend. Since introduced, it went through some changes, now its time to change it to Stars of the night, so top 3 players of the night will be awarded and a player with most selections will be given <a href="sc.php?id=awards.php&trophy=lester">Lester B. Pearson Trophy</a>.<hr>If you are still reading, I would like to remind you of some web features, which are used not so often, first all Stanley Cup managers can write their press news (team blog or whatever you want to call it) in our <a href="sc.php?id=magazine.php">magazine</a><p>Second all our players stats are sortable by column, all you have to do is to select something from the selection form and than you can sort your selection by any column (to know who is best or worst in +/- or asists...).<p>When browsing through schedule, you can use the team selector to view only your team and you can send challenges from the web by clicking home/away (read [challenge help] on top of schedule page)<p>(Almost) complete list of our web features is here <a href="sc.php?id=data/web.html">here</a>.<p>Good luck in season 17 ;)
